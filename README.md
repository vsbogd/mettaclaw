# Meet Oma

Oma is the first Telegram agent built on the OmegaClaw framework. Interacting
with Oma is the fastest way to experience what we’re building with OmegaClaw.

## Overview

OmegaClaw is a neural-symbolic agent framework built on the Hyperon AGI stack.
It unifies large language models with a formal symbolic layer to create a
stateful cognitive architecture capable of auditable inference, autonomous
self-improvement, and long-term persistence.

Unlike reactive, session-based agents, OmegaClaw operates in a continuous
execution loop, managing its own goals and providing auditable proof trails for
its reasoning.

The primary design criteria for OmegaClaw were simplicity, ease of extension,
and transparent implementation. This results in a minimalist MeTTa-based core
of approximately 200 lines of code.

## Installation

Prerequisites: Git, Python3, Pip and [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) library

Get [SWI-Prolog 9.1.12 or later](https://www.swi-prolog.org/).

Install OmegaClaw:
```
git clone https://github.com/trueagi-io/PeTTa
cd PeTTa
mkdir -p repos
git clone https://github.com/asi-alliance/OmegaClaw-Core.git repos/OmegaClaw-Core
git clone https://github.com/patham9/petta_lib_chromadb.git repos/petta_lib_chromadb
cp repos/OmegaClaw-Core/run.metta ./
```

Setup Python virtual environment (or use your own):
```
python3 -m venv ./.venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
```

If you have CPU only machine or don't want calculate embeddings on GPU:
```
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch
```

Install Python dependencies:
```
python3 -m pip install -r ./repos/OmegaClaw-Core/requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Before running the system you need to choose your LLM API provider and export the API key as the environment variable.
| Provider | Env var name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Anthropic` (default) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude models via the Anthropic API. |
| `OpenAI` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | GPT models. Also reused by the OpenAI embedding provider below. |
| `ASICloud` | `ASI_API_KEY` |  MiniMax models via ASI Alliance inference endpoint (`inference.asicloud.cudos.org`). |
| `ASIOne` | `ASIONE_API_KEY` |  ASI1 Ultra model via ASI:One inference endpoint (`https://api.asi1.ai/v1`). |
| `Ollama-local` | `OLLAMA_API_KEY` |  Ollama model via local inference endpoint. API endpoint is set via `LLM_SERVER_LOCAL_URL` environment variables. |
| `OpenRouter` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |  GLM model via OpenRouter inference endpoint. |

Run the system via the following command which ensures the system is started from the root folder of PeTTa:
```
OMEGACLAW_AUTH_SECRET=<channel-secret> sh run.sh run.metta IRC_channel="<irc-channel>"
```
After start go to https://webchat.quakenet.org/ to communicate with the agent. Join `<irc-channel>` and after agent is joined send `auth <channel-secret>` message to authenticate yourself as an agent owner. Please replace `<irc-channel>` and `<channel-secret>` by your own values.

### Import Knowledge

If you are running OmegaClaw without Docker and would like to load it with preset knowledge, follow these steps:

1. Set EMBEDDING_PROVIDER in your environment. It can be set to either OpenAI or Local. OpenAI embeddings also require OPENAI_API_KEY to be set in your environment.

2. Run:
```
  sh ./import_knowledge.sh
```
After the script finishes, your OmegaClaw bot will have the preset knowledge stored in its long-term memory (LTM).

If you want to skip preloading the knowledge then run `export IMPORT_KB_ON_START=0`

| `maxWakeLoops` | 1 | Extra turns granted on each scheduled wake-up |
| `sleepInterval` | 1 | Delay between loop iterations (seconds) |
| `wakeupInterval` | 600 | How long idle before the next scheduled wake-up (seconds) |
| `LLM` | `gpt-5.4` | Model identifier passed to the provider (used with OpenAI provider only) |

[OpenShell
YAML](https://docs.nvidia.com/openshell/reference/policy-schema#filesystem-policy).
See [./profile/policy.yaml](./profile/policy.yaml) as an example. Empty value
disables restrictions. |
