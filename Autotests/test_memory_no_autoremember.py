"""
Live test (negative): a HUMAN_MESSAGE alone must not autopromote into
ChromaDB. The agent should write to long-term memory only when it
explicitly invokes (remember ...). This test does NOT mock the LLM —
the question being asked ("does the agent voluntarily call remember
on a fact-shaped sentence?") is only meaningful with a real model.

We send a fact-shaped statement that does not request anything. The
agent is allowed to acknowledge via (send ...) or even (pin ...), but
must not write a ChromaDB vector unless it explicitly chose to. The
test reports the agent's choice; passing means "no implicit promotion
to long-term memory".
