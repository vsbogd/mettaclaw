"""
Mock test: Tier-3 -> Tier-2 transition. A reasoning conclusion produced
inside an AtomSpace via (metta ...) is ephemeral by design; if the agent
wants to keep it, it must call (remember ...) on the conclusion.

Turn 1 mock answer dictates a metta inference call AND a remember call
with the conclusion. Verification confirms both fired and the ChromaDB
vector count grew by one.

Run:
    pytest test_transition_metta_to_remember_mock.py -s
