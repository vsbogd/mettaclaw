"""
Mock test: explicit transition working-memory -> long-term memory.

Turn 1: the agent pins a checklist into working memory.
Turn 2: the agent is asked to commit the pin to long-term memory via
        the remember skill.

Verification: both skill calls landed, and the ChromaDB vector count
grew by exactly one — i.e., the working-memory item was promoted to
the persistent embedding store.

Run:
    pytest test_transition_pin_to_remember_mock.py -s
