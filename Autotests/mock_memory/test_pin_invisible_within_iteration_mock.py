"""
Mock test (negative): a (pin ...) emitted within an iteration is NOT
visible inside the same iteration's HISTORY context. The prompt is
assembled BEFORE skill evaluation, so the pin block — written by
addToHistory at the END of the iteration — only enters HISTORY at the
next prompt-build.

Verification reads the docker log: the CHARS_SENT line that carries
the PROMPT for the iteration containing our pin must NOT contain the
pin's unique marker; the NEXT CHARS_SENT line (next iteration) must.

Run:
    pytest test_pin_invisible_within_iteration_mock.py -s
