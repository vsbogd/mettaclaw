"""
Mock variant of test_search_invalid.

The live test exercises the agent's behaviour on a gibberish query —
both the search skill call and the agent's "no results" relay. Under
the mock we skip the search skill (it would still hit the network) and
deliver the negation reply directly via (send ...). The mock variant
therefore narrows the assertion to the content of the relay; the live
variant remains the source of truth for end-to-end behaviour.

Run:
    pytest test_search_invalid_mock.py -s
