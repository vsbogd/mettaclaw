"""
Mock variant of test_skill_episodes.

Two-turn flow with mocked LLM:

  1. Seed: agent acknowledges a unique BEACON marker via send.
  2. Recall: after a settle pause, agent invokes (episodes ...) at the
     captured timestamp and sends a reply naming the BEACON.

history.metta is written for real by the agent loop; only the LLM
choice is mocked.

Run:
    pytest test_skill_episodes_mock.py -s
