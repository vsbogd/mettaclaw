"""
Mock variant of test_memory_history.

The mocked LLM response sends back a (send ...) acknowledgement carrying
our REQ-tag. The history.metta file is written for real by the agent
loop after each iteration; the mock only fixes the agent's reply so the
test can verify the bookkeeping deterministically.

Run:
    pytest test_memory_history_mock.py -s
