"""
Mock variant of test_search_basic.

Note on scope: the live test exercises both the search skill (network)
and the agent's ability to relay project-specific content. Under the
mock we control only the LLM dispatch — the search skill itself still
hits the network. To keep the mock variant deterministic and free of
network dependencies, the mocked response skips the search call and
delivers the answer directly via (send ...). This narrows the test to
content-relay verification; the live variant remains the source of
truth for end-to-end search behaviour.

Run:
    pytest test_search_basic_mock.py -s
