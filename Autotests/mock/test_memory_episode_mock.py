"""
Mock variant of test_memory_episode.

Two-turn flow with mocked LLM dispatches:

  1. Seed: agent answers (remember "<fact>") on the vet/Barney prompt.
  2. Recall: agent answers (query "<phrase>") + (send "<reply>") on the
     follow-up. The reply text already contains the date and the
     dog/tooth keywords, so the recall does not depend on the agent's
     ability to compose a natural-language summary from the query
     result.

ChromaDB and history.metta are written for real — only the LLM
choice is mocked.

Run:
    pytest test_memory_episode_mock.py -s
