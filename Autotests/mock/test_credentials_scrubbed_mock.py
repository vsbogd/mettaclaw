"""
Test (OMEGA-38): provider/channel secrets are scrubbed from the agent
process environment.

entrypoint.sh runs the agent as `nobody` and rebuilds the environment
with `env -i` + a SAFE_VARS allowlist, so no provider key, channel token,
or auth secret survives into the agent process.

Red/green: before the fix the agent was the container's main process and
inherited every `-e` var. OMEGACLAW_AUTH_SECRET is always injected by
scripts/omegaclaw (default 0000), so it is the reliable marker: this test
is RED before the fix and GREEN after.

The agent reads its OWN environment via the shell skill, because only the
process owner can read it (container root lacks CAP_SYS_PTRACE under
no-new-privileges).
