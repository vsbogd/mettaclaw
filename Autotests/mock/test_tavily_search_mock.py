"""
Mock variant of test_tavily_search.

The live test exercises the external Tavily uAgent. Under the mock the
external skill is not reachable in a deterministic way — the mocked
response delivers the answer directly via (send ...). The mock variant
therefore narrows the assertion to "did the agent surface a reply that
contains Fetch.ai-specific content"; the live variant remains the
source of truth for skill invocation.

Run:
    pytest test_tavily_search_mock.py -s
