# Reference — Channels

Channels are the I/O surface the agent uses to talk to the outside world. Adapters live in `channels/`; MeTTa-side dispatch lives in `src/channels.metta`.

## The adapter contract

Each adapter exposes:

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `start_<name>(...)` | Called once from `initChannels`. Opens sockets / spawns listener threads as needed. |
| `getLastMessage()` | Returns the next unread inbound message as a string. Returns `""` if none. |
| `send_message(str)` | Posts an outbound message. |

The MeTTa side reads `commchannel` and branches:

```metta
(= (receive)
   (if (== (commchannel) irc)
       (py-call (irc.getLastMessage))
       (if (== (commchannel) telegram)
           (py-call (telegram.getLastMessage))
           (if (== (commchannel) slack)
               (py-call (slack.getLastMessage))
               (py-call (mattermost.getLastMessage))))))
```

## `channels/irc.py`

IRC adapter with simple one-time-secret authentication.

- `start_irc(channel, server, port, user)` — connect and join.
- Inbound traffic is filtered to the first user who types `auth <one-time-secret>`. All other speakers are ignored.
- Uses QuakeNet (`irc.quakenet.org`) by default.

## `channels/mattermost.py`

Mattermost adapter using a bot token.

- `start_mattermost(url, channel_id)` — connect to a Mattermost instance.
- Requires `MM_BOT_TOKEN` environment variable.

## `channels/telegram.py`

Telegram adapter using Bot API long polling.

- `start_telegram(chat_id, poll_timeout)` — starts a poll loop.
- `TG_CHAT_ID` is optional; if empty, the adapter can auto-bind to the first valid inbound chat.
- Outbound messages are chunked to Telegram-safe lengths.

## `channels/slack.py`

Slack adapter using Slack Web API polling.

- `start_slack(channel_id, poll_interval)` — starts a poll loop.
- `SL_CHANNEL_ID` is optional.
- The bot user must already be invited to the target channel.
- If `SL_CHANNEL_ID` is empty, the adapter auto-binds to the first channel where auth succeeds.
- Adapter respects Slack `Retry-After` backoff on HTTP 429 and enforces a minimum 60s poll interval.
- Uses the same one-time `auth <secret>` ownership gate as the other adapters.
