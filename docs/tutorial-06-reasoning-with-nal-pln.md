# Tutorial 06 — Reasoning with NAL and PLN

**Goal:** invoke Non-Axiomatic Logic and Probabilistic Logic Networks from inside OmegaClaw using the `(metta ...)` skill, and read the truth values the engines emit.

## Prerequisites

- A running OmegaClaw.
- Reading familiarity with `(stv frequency confidence)` truth values.

## The `metta` skill

```metta
(metta sexpression)
```

`metta` evaluates an arbitrary MeTTa s-expression in the agent's AtomSpace. NAL and PLN are plain MeTTa libraries (`lib_nal.metta`, `lib_pln.metta`) — you reach them by passing the right expression to `metta`.

---

## NAL — the `|-` operator

### Example 1 — Deduction (golden retriever → family friendly)

```metta
(metta (|- ((--> golden_retriever friendly)         (stv 1.0 0.9))
           ((--> friendly         family_friendly)  (stv 0.9 0.85))))
```

Expected conclusion:

```
(--> golden_retriever family_friendly) (stv 0.9 0.6885)
```

Where `c = 1.0 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.85 = 0.6885`. This is above the ACT threshold (`c ≥ 0.5`) so the conclusion is actionable.

### Example 2 — Abduction (wet grass ← rained)

```metta
(metta (|- ((==> rained wetGrass) (stv 1.0 0.9))
           (wetGrass               (stv 1.0 0.9))))
```

Abduction output confidence is bounded at ~0.45. The output correctly tells you **"probably rained, but do not act on this alone — corroborate."**

### Example 3 — Revision (three sources agree)

```metta
(metta (|- ((--> wolf animal) (stv 1.0 0.45))
           ((--> wolf animal) (stv 1.0 0.45))))
```

First revision: `(stv 1.0 0.62)`. Revising a third source at `(stv 1.0 0.45)` in:

```
→ (--> wolf animal) (stv 1.0 0.647)
```

Five independent sources at the same level revise to `(stv 0.848 0.937)` — solidly in ACT territory.

### Example 4 — Contradiction detection

```metta
(metta (|- ((--> cat dangerous) (stv 0.2 0.8))  ; most cats not dangerous
           ((--> cat dangerous) (stv 0.9 0.5))  ; someone claims dangerous
           ))
```

Output:

```
(--> cat dangerous) (stv 0.395 0.875)
```

`f = 0.395, c = 0.875` is the engine saying: *"substantial but conflicting evidence."* Do not pick a side — surface the disagreement with both source citations. See [tutorial-09-reliable-reasoning.md](./tutorial-09-reliable-reasoning.md) §8.

### Example 5 — Implication with variables

```metta
(metta (|- ((==> (--> (× $1 elephant) eat) (--> $1 ([] dangerous))) (stv 1.0 0.9))
           ((--> (× tiger elephant) eat)                            (stv 1.0 0.9))))
```

`$1` is an independent variable. The engine unifies `$1 = tiger` and emits `(--> tiger ([] dangerous))`.

### Example 6 — Analogy (weaker transfer)

```metta
(metta (|- ((<-> golden_retriever poodle)  (stv 0.25 0.4))   ; share playful, friendly
           ((--> poodle           smart)   (stv 1.0  0.9))))
```

Conclusion: `(--> golden_retriever smart) (stv 0.25 0.36)`. The low confidence correctly signals *analogical transfer, not direct evidence*.

---

## PLN — the `|~` operator

### Example 7 — Forward chaining (Modus Ponens)

```metta
(metta (|~ ((Implication (Inheritance $1 (IntSet Feathered))
                         (Inheritance $1 Bird)) (stv 1.0 0.9))
           ((Inheritance Pingu (IntSet Feathered)) (stv 1.0 0.9))))
```

Conclusion: `(Inheritance Pingu Bird)` with a derived `(stv ...)` by the same `f₁ × f₂, f₁ × f₂ × c₁ × c₂` formula as NAL deduction.

### Example 8 — PLN abduction on inheritance

```metta
(metta (|~ ((Inheritance bird flyer)  (stv 1.0 0.9))
           ((Inheritance robin flyer) (stv 1.0 0.9))))
```

Conclusion: `(Inheritance robin bird) (stv 0.767 0.422)`. Below ACT — treat as a hypothesis to verify.

---

## Using reasoning inside the agent loop

Ask the agent a question that requires inference:

```
given that pingu has feathers and feathered things are birds,
is pingu a bird?
```

A well-behaved response:

1. Atomizes the two premises.
2. Emits `(metta (|~ ...))` with those premises.
3. Reads the `(stv ...)` of the conclusion.
4. Checks the action threshold (ACT / HYPOTHESIZE / IGNORE).
5. `send`s an answer that includes the derived confidence and the rule used.

---

## Multi-hop degradation — a warning

Starting with each premise at `c = 0.9`:

| Hop | Output `c` |
|---|---|
| 1 | 0.81 |
| 2 | 0.73 |
| 3 | **< 0.5** (below ACT) |
| 4 | ~0.25 (IGNORE) |

**Practical implication:** keep deduction chains to 2–3 hops; use revision with independent evidence to restore confidence before continuing. See [tutorial-09-reliable-reasoning.md](./tutorial-09-reliable-reasoning.md).

---

## Verification

- `docker logs` shows the `(metta (|- ...))` or `(metta (|~ ...))` call and its conclusion with an updated `(stv ...)`.
- Revision on shared terms produces confidence **strictly greater** than either input — this is a quick sanity check that revision is firing.
- Deduction confidence matches `f₁ × f₂ × c₁ × c₂` within rounding.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Term order reversed | Inference returns empty | Verify which term is the subject vs. predicate. Asymmetric swap errors run ~16.6%. |
| Wrong copula | Empty or nonsensical result | `-->` (inheritance), `==>` (implication), `<->` (similarity) — choose carefully. |
| Chain too long | Conclusion below ACT | Insert revision with independent evidence. |
| Self-assigned confidence | Overconfident conclusions | Ground the premise externally — see [tutorial-08-grounded-reasoning.md](./tutorial-08-grounded-reasoning.md). |
