# Internals — Memory Store

OmegaClaw uses a **three-tier memory architecture**. Each tier has distinct semantics, persistence, and purpose. Choosing the wrong tier is one of the easier performance and reliability foot-guns.

## Overview

| Tier | Skill | Persistence | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Working memory | `pin` | Single slot, overwritten per cycle, session-local | Task state — "what am I doing right now?" |
| 2. Long-term embedding memory | `remember` / `query` | Persistent across sessions | Accumulated knowledge, semantic recall |
| 3. AtomSpace | `(metta ...)` | Per-invocation (fresh AtomSpace each `\|-` call) | Formal reasoning over truth-valued atoms |

---

## 1. Working memory — `pin`

### Purpose
Holds the agent's current task state: what it is doing, what step comes next, what intermediate results matter.

### Characteristics
- **Limited, volatile, constantly updated.**
- Each cycle can overwrite the previous pin.
- Does **not** persist across sessions.
- Analogous to human working memory.

### Use it for
- Multi-step plans currently in flight.
- Intermediate results the next turn needs to see.
- Checklists that do not need to outlive the current task.

### Do not use it for
- Anything that must survive a restart — use `remember` instead.
- Structured knowledge the reasoner should act on — atomize into AtomSpace via `(metta ...)`.

---

## 2. Long-term embedding memory — `remember` / `query`

Backed by ChromaDB via a Python bridge (`lib_chromadb`, invoked from `src/memory.metta`).

### Storage format
Each item is the triplet:

```
(timestamp, atom, embedding)
```

- `timestamp` — produced by `get_time_as_string`, format `"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"`.
- `atom` — the raw string, post-`string-safe` (escapes `"`, newlines, `'`).
- `embedding` — vector from `embed $str`, dispatching on `embeddingprovider`:
  - `Local` → `lib_llm_ext.useLocalEmbedding`.
  - `OpenAI` → `useGPTEmbedding`.

### Write path

```
(remember $str)
  → py-call (lib_chromadb.remember $str (embed $str) (get_time_as_string))
```

### Semantic read

```
(query $str)
  → py-call (lib_chromadb.query (embed $str) (maxRecallItems))
```

Returns the top-`k` items by embedding similarity. **Known issue:** query can miss relevant results when embedding similarity thresholds do not match the query phrasing.

### Time-window read

```
(episodes $time)
  → py-call (helper.around_time $time (maxEpisodeRecallLines))
```

Reads lines around `$time` from `memory/history.metta` — the **episodic trace**, not the embedding store. See §4 below.

### Use it for
- Facts that must persist across sessions.
- Verified, grounded premises (attach provenance in the atom body).
- Accumulated user preferences, skills learned, lessons.

### Do not use it for
- Ephemeral scratchpad state — use `pin`.
- Knowledge you intend to reason over in the same turn — atomize via `(metta ...)`.

---

## 3. AtomSpace — where reasoning happens

### Purpose
When the agent needs to **reason rather than just recall**, knowledge must be decomposed into atomic logical statements and loaded into MeTTa's AtomSpace.

### Atomization

Natural-language fact:

> Sam and Garfield are friends, and Garfield is an animal.

Atomized:

```metta
(--> (× sam garfield) friend)  (stv 1.0 0.9)
(--> garfield animal)          (stv 1.0 0.9)
```

Each atom has an **explicit relationship type** and an **explicit truth value**. This is not formatting — it unlocks operations impossible on raw text:

1. **Composable inference** — atoms combined by the engine to derive new knowledge.
2. **Evidence tracking** — when two sources confirm the same fact, revision merges them into stronger belief.
3. **Formal contradiction detection** — an atom with `(stv 0.0 0.9)` explicitly represents strong evidence of negation.
4. **Surgical updates** — individual atoms can be revised without touching the rest of the knowledge base.

### Critical structural constraint

> Each `(metta (|- ...))` call **starts with a fresh AtomSpace.** Knowledge does not persist between invocations.

This means multi-step reasoning requires the LLM to manually carry results forward — pin them, or write them back to long-term memory and re-load on the next cycle.

---

## 4. The episodic trace

A fourth, plainer store lives alongside the three tiers above: the plain-text file `memory/history.metta`, appended to by `appendToHistory` at the end of each turn.

Each appended block contains:

- Timestamp.
- `HUMAN_MESSAGE:` line when new input arrived.
- The LLM's response s-expression.
- `ERROR_FEEDBACK:` when the loop captured an error.

The trailing `maxHistory` characters are loaded back into the prompt as `HISTORY` context. `(episodes ts)` reads lines around a timestamp.

The episodic trace is not a separate "tier" in the same sense — it is the running log that makes the short-horizon loop work. `pin` writes into it; `remember` writes around it.

---

## The three-tier interaction loop

A reasoning-heavy turn typically cycles through all three tiers:

```
1. query     — recall relevant past findings (Tier 2)
2. atomize   — convert relevant knowledge into MeTTa atoms (Tier 3)
3. reason    — (metta (|- ...)) over atoms
4. remember  — store novel conclusions with provenance (Tier 2)
5. pin       — capture reasoning state for next cycle (Tier 1)
```

---

## Why two persistent stores

- **Long-term memory** uses embeddings for semantic recall across arbitrary time spans. Content is natural language.
- **AtomSpace** uses formal atoms with explicit truth values for inference. Content is structured, not text.

They are complementary, not overlapping. Long-term memory *feeds* the AtomSpace by supplying candidate facts; the AtomSpace *reasons over* them; novel conclusions are *stored back* into long-term memory as atomized strings.
