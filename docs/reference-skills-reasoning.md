# Reference — Reasoning Skill

Defined in `src/skills.metta`. Backed by three reasoning engines in `lib_nal.metta`, `lib_pln.metta`, and the ONA bindings.

## `metta`

### Signature
```metta
(metta sexpression)
```

### Purpose
Evaluate an arbitrary MeTTa s-expression in the agent's AtomSpace. Primary use is to invoke **NAL** (`|-`), **PLN** (`|~`), or **ONA** (temporal) inference from within the agent loop.

### Parameters
- `sexpression` — a MeTTa s-expression. Read by `sread`, evaluated by `eval`.

### Returns
Whatever the inner expression returns. For NAL/PLN calls, this is a conclusion atom paired with an `(stv frequency confidence)` truth value.

### Examples

**NAL — deduction:**
```metta
(metta (|- ((--> (× sam garfield) friend) (stv 1.0 0.9))
           ((--> garfield animal)         (stv 1.0 0.9))))
```

**NAL — implication with a variable (note `$1`):**
```metta
(metta (|- ((==> (--> (× $1 elephant) eat) (--> $1 ([] dangerous))) (stv 1.0 0.9))
           ((--> (× tiger elephant) eat)                            (stv 1.0 0.9))))
```

**NAL — revision** (same term, two sources): `|-` merges the evidence.

**PLN — forward chaining:**
```metta
(metta (|~ ((Implication (Inheritance $1 (IntSet Feathered))
                         (Inheritance $1 Bird)) (stv 1.0 0.9))
           ((Inheritance Pingu (IntSet Feathered)) (stv 1.0 0.9))))
```

## Engine selection

Pattern-to-engine mapping (summary — see [reference-orchestration.md](./reference-orchestration.md) for the full table):

| Situation | Engine |
|---|---|
| Known chain `A → B → C` | NAL `\|-` |
| Observed effect, seeking cause | NAL `\|-` |
| Multiple instances → generalization | NAL `\|-` + Revision |
| Property-based categorical inference | PLN `\|~` |
| Independent evidence to merge | NAL or PLN revision |
| Real-time temporal sequences | ONA |

Fallback rule: if an engine returns empty, reformulate premises (fix term order or missing middle). If still empty, switch engine.

## Stopping criteria

Halt conditions the LLM is expected to monitor:

| Signal | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Confidence floor | `c < 0.3` | Halt — conclusion unreliable. |
| Sufficiency threshold | `c ≥ 0.6` | Actionable for decisions. |
| Diminishing returns | hop reduces `c` more than it adds information | Halt. |
| Resource budget | 5 commands per cycle | Hard ceiling (loop-enforced). |

---

## Action thresholds

Before acting on a conclusion's `(f, c)`:

| Tier | Gate | Do |
|---|---|---|
| **ACT** | `f ≥ 0.6 AND c ≥ 0.5` | Take the step. |
| **HYPOTHESIZE** | `f ≥ 0.3 AND c ≥ 0.2` | Gather more evidence. |
| **IGNORE** | below | Do nothing. |

---

## Notes / limits

- Independent variables are written `$1`, `$2`, …
- Negated knowledge uses `(stv 0.0 c)`.
- `metta` evaluates **any** MeTTa expression, not just reasoning calls. Malformed input reports errors through `&error` on the next turn.
- Confidence decays ~10% per deduction hop. Chains past 3 hops usually fall below the ACT threshold — see [tutorial-09-reliable-reasoning.md](./tutorial-09-reliable-reasoning.md).
- Premise formulation is the primary failure surface. Verify term order, copula, and granularity before trusting a conclusion. See [reference-failure-modes.md](./reference-failure-modes.md).
